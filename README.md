# ass4
Changes:
1) Fixed simplify problems (we didnt have a problem in the division simplification exactly
we just returned it upside down, it was upposed to be 1/7 and not 7/1, oooooooops...).
2) Added switch case for evaluate and put it on BaseExpression and BinaryExpression (yes micha said we dont need to, but yoav said we do at least some of it, and someone from second year said he did it too, and i can move simplify their too if i have evaluate their so i think its better).
